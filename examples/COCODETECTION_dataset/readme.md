Additional Info:
- COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, it's a widely used dataset for object detection, segmentation, and captioning tasks.
- The COCO dataset contains images with multiple objects in various contexts, annotated with bounding boxes around the objects and segmentation masks for object instances. It covers a wide range of object categories, making it valuable for training and evaluating computer vision models.
